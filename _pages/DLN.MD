# Course Reflection

As an 18 year old university student, I embarked on a new academic adventure this semester: an introductory course in Digital Humanities. Little did I know that it would transform the way I perceive, interact with, and create content in the digital realm. This narrative explores my evolving digital literacy journey, the strategies I employ in my daily and academic life, and my aspirations for what lies ahead. 

Taking a class on digital humanities, I am learning about how to effectively utilize technology in my daily and academic life. Growing up in the digital age, I have always been familiar with various social media platforms and online tools for content creation. However, I never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities.

Before enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around the basics. I knew how to use social media platforms, compose emails, and write research papers using Google Docs. I used Google Drive for document storage and Google Calendar for scheduling. My content creation process revolved around the simple tools available on my smartphone, and I hardly ventured beyond that comfort zone. Socially, I interacted with friends and classmates on Instagram, Snapchat, and iMessage, but I never delved into the deeper aspects of online communities or digital communication. I have always appreciated the convenience and accessibility of these platforms for staying connected with others. However, I have also become more aware of the potential risks and limitations of relying too heavily on social media, such as the impact on mental health and privacy concerns. I never truly explored the wealth of digital tools available for research, data management, and analysis. Frankly, I was swimming in the shallow end of the digital pool, unaware of the vast ocean of possibilities that awaited. 

For content creation, I use a variety of tools such as Canva and iMovie to create graphics and videos for personal projects. I have also recently discovered the potential of using video editing software like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere to enhance my content and make it more visually appealing, but I haven't gotten to use them yet.

In terms of research data management, I have primarily relied on Google Drive for storing and organizing my academic papers and projects. I have also used Google Docs and Google Spreadsheets for basic data analysis, such as creating charts and graphs. However, I have come to realize that these tools may not always be sufficient for more complex data manipulation and analysis.

The digital humanities course has opened my eyes to the vast array of technology and tools available for research data management and analysis. I am fascinated by the potential of many tools offered today that revolutionize the way we approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn more about how to apply them in my academic and professional life.

Social interaction, too, took on a new dimension as I explored platforms like Quora, Discord, and Reddit, which facilitated discussions and collaboration in ways I had never experienced before. I began to see how online communities formed around shared interests, and I realized the potential for networking and learning from experts in various fields.

Furthermore, I am intrigued by the ethical implications of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices.

Despite my already limited prior experience with technology and my slight knowledge from the digital humanities course, I still feel that my abilities in this area are limited, and I would like to learn more. I am aware that there is so much more to learn, and I am excited to continue to expand my skills and knowledge in the field.

In conclusion, my digital literacy journey as a university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been eye-opening and enriching. I have come to appreciate the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis, and I am eager to continue learning about how to effectively utilize these tools in my academic and professional life. While I have some basic skills in content creation and social interaction, I am aware that there is still much more to learn and I am eager to continue to expand my knowledge and abilities in this area.
