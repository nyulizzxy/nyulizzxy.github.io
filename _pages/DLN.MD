# Course Reflection

As an 18 year old **first year** university student studying at an American Liberal Arts school in Abu Dhabi, UAE, I embarked on a new academic adventure this semester: an introductory course in ***Digital Humanities.*** It was quite a big turn from the courses I took last semester. Now that I have *fully* completed the course, I have learned the **extent** in which it would transformed the way I perceive, interact with, and create content in the digital realm. 

This narrative explores my evolving digital literacy journey, the strategies I employ in my daily and academic life, what I learned from this class, and my aspirations for what lies ahead. 

## Backstory

I applied to NYUAD planning to be a Social Research & Public Policy (SRPP) major, so I took Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, a major requirement for SRPP and other Social Science majors, and Social Change and Development in the Arab World, an SRPP elective. 

I kept having crises over my major, thinking of double majoring in SRPP and Business, Organizations, and Society (BOS), then to just majoring in BOS, then to majoring in Electrical Engineering, then majoring in Film and New Media, then to Interactive Media, and now to double majoring in Interactive Media and Film and New Media. 

***Ironic Update***: *I am now a Film and New Media major with plans to minor in Interactive Media and Psychology*

## Joining This Class

I had no experience with coding, and the most experience I had with classes about digital things was the core class I took last semester, ***Digital Archive***. Taking Digital Archive, I learned quite a lot of things that have been brought up in this class, Intro to Digital Humanities, which makes sense because of the digital framework. Methods such as crowdsourcing, [organizing data using spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989?needAccess=true), platforms such as Zotero and ArcGIS, projects such as [Cultural Heritage Preservation](https://www.singaporememories.gov.sg/), and the [usage of AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X4kaiFPXz4) in the field are all things that I noticed have overlapped between the two classes. 

It’s very relieving to see a lot of the same material pop up in this class because at least I already know some of the things we talk about in Digital Humanities. 

Furthermore, in Digital Archive, we had three paths that we could take for our final project. Make an **ArcGIS Interactive Story Map**, make an **Omeka** exhibit, or make a **machine-readable corpus** on a topic of our choice. I chose to do the ArcGIS Story Map, so I'm very interested in our upcoming assignment in Digital Humanities, where we have to explore textual data from a custom corpus. In a way, it allows me to  experience what it would've been like if I chose to create a corpus for my final Digital Archive project. 

**Updated Me**: Now that I have completed the corpus assignment, it was *much more different* than what I had envisioned. Obviously, the assignments themselves were different despite them both being related to corpus. However, my brain didn't quite comprehend that until I had finished completing ITDH Assignment 2. I actually feel like I ***enjoyed it more*** than I would've enjoyed the Digital Archive assignment because of our use of **word clouds**. I never knew word clouds existed before taking this class, and I find the creation and use of word clouds to be creative, cute, and informational. Word clouds are such a great way to sort words in my opinion, and they are ***much easier*** to read and interpret than boring thick spreadsheets. 

*After* taking this class on Digital Humanities, I learned a lot more about how to effectively utilize technology in my daily and academic life, as well as the impacts the digital field plays on all sorts of things and all sorts of people. By using platforms such as **GitHub**, **Voyant Tools**, **Kepler**, I learned how to navigate through new online resources. Although GitHub isn't as coding intensive as let's say an Intro to CS course or an Intro to IM course, I ***did manage*** to learn a good amount on how to code on GitHub and use certain syntax to make my word prettier and more easy to read.

*Thanks to Professor Wrisley*, I realized the **importance** of making sure that even digital work should be ***clear, simple, and easy to read.*** Ironically, I learned this through the word cloud assignment, after I asked the professor why I lost a few points on it. Turns out, a lot of the damage was from *poor formatting*. 

I find that I usually have this issue with fonts and sizes on ***physical books***, but I **don't** struggle as much with ***digital books/content*** simply because it is already digital. This **put into perspective** how the cases could be completely different for someone else who isn't as used to digital work or just generally prefers physical work.

As such, I used commands such as two hashtags, one star on each side, two stars on each side, and hyperlinks to manage the way my work is presented. I came to realize how much of a difference this makes **without** me having to actually ***change up the literal contents of my work***. 
 

In addition to the many similar aspects between this class and my previous class, another factor that has been making my experience with this class particularly enriching was the ***diverse group of classmates*** who joined me. 

Our majors spanned a **wide spectrum** of disciplines, including Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing. Together, we have explored digital literacy, each bringing a unique set of strategies and skills into the classroom. 

In addition, our professor mentioned that this class **isn’t** like your *average Interactive Media class*, which I find interesting and exciting since I get the opportunity to explore different areas of Interactive Digital Media from this class and the other Interactive Media classes I’m taking. Before further immersing ourselves in the world of digital humanities, we had already developed our own strategies for navigating the digital landscape in both daily life and academics.

My peers from Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing had their own digital toolkits. Interactive Media students excelled in user-centered design and interactive storytelling, often utilizing software like Adobe Creative Suite. Film and New Media enthusiasts delved into multimedia production and digital narrative creation. Environmental Studies majors leveraged data analysis software for environmental research, while Business and Marketing students honed their skills in data analytics platforms for market analysis. Students in Literature and Creative Writing dived deep into research databases to fuel their literary and artistic pursuits.

*However*, the digital humanities course has illuminated the intersection of our diverse disciplines in the digital age. Content creation, once thought to be confined to specific fields, took on a multidisciplinary dimension. We explored creating interactive websites, digital art installations, immersive narratives, and AI-generated content. Our collaborative efforts showcased the power of interdisciplinary collaboration, blurring the lines between art, science, and storytelling.

This is even more interesting to read back on after completing the **Unproject assignment,** where Linus and I decided to work on an **AI model** that human consultants would use to ***help content creators go viral***. Not only does living in a digital world affect the way in which we now submit our work, where we submit through GitHub and Google Docs/Spreadsheet instead of physical paper, it also affects the realms of our assignments since we can expand and work on social media platforms and other digital platforms.


Growing up in the digital age, I have always been *familiar* with various social media platforms and online tools for content creation. However, I never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis ***until*** I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities.

*Before* enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around the **basics**. I knew how to use social media platforms, compose emails, and write research papers using Google Docs. I used Google Drive for document storage and Google Calendar for scheduling. My content creation process revolved around the simple tools available on my smartphone, and I hardly ventured beyond that comfort zone. 

Socially, I interacted with friends and classmates on Instagram, Snapchat, and iMessage, but I never delved into the deeper aspects of online communities or digital communication. I have always appreciated the convenience and accessibility of these platforms for staying connected with others. However, I have also become *more aware* of the ***potential risks*** and limitations of relying **too heavily on social media**, such as the impact on mental health and privacy concerns. I never truly explored the wealth of digital tools available for research, data management, and analysis. Frankly, I was swimming in the shallow end of the digital pool, unaware of the vast ocean of possibilities that awaited. 

Research data management and manipulation emerged as a common thread that united us all. We delved into text analysis, data visualization, and digital archives. Tools like **Zotero** and **Omeka** became invaluable for organizing, annotating, and sharing research materials. 

The *importance* of data literacy transcended individual majors, equipping us to navigate the data-driven landscape of the digital age.
Our critical reflection on our current abilities led us to appreciate the concept of “computational thinking” in the **age of AI**. We understood that skills in data analysis, algorithm understanding, and result interpretation were universally valuable, regardless of our major. 

As AI continues to **shape our world**, these skills will empower us to harness its potential for innovation and informed decision-making.
Digital humanities has ***broadened our horizons***, offering fresh perspectives on our respective fields of study. We began to contemplate the ethical implications of AI and data usage within our disciplines. Computer Science majors questioned the ethical responsibilities of AI developers, while Literature and Creative Writing students considered the impact of AI-generated content on storytelling. Environmental Studies majors explored AI’s potential in climate change monitoring, and Business and Marketing students delved into AI-driven market analysis.

Looking ahead, have completed our exploration of new ways of thinking and working through **Professor Wrisley's teachings** in ***Intro to Digital Humanities***. We aim to value and use the insightful knowledge learned from this class and **apply them** into our *digitally driven world* that is only **bound to expand** and grow as we move on with advancing our technology. We envision a future where collaboration between artists, scientists, scholars, and creators becomes the norm, fostering innovation and pushing the boundaries of our fields.


Furthermore, I am still intrigued by the ***ethical implications*** of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices.

I was also intruiged by how many assignments **required** the ***usage of ChatGPT***, a resource that is often frowned upon by many educators. I wasn't aware of ChatGPT or other generative AI platforms before coming to university, and it is usually only permitted for brainstorming and ideas. However, I found it quite **fascinating** that we had to use Chat GPT to generate responses for us, and then we edit/adjust them accordingly to our assignments. 

It was something I didn't quite expect, especially in a school setting, but I learned quite a lot about *perspectives* through it. When it comes to things like writing a Digital Literary Narrative on our behalf, it is really **linear** and **monotoned** because of the ***lack of personal experiences***. Even if I used ChatGPT 4.0, I doubt that it would have been able to get in as much personal story as me writing it myself. Although this can change in the future as AI gets more advanced, I found it to be an interesting assignment to work on, especially with three phases that we keep editing and updating what ChatGPT wrote for us.

Despite my already limited prior experience with technology and my slight knowledge from the digital humanities course, I still feel that my abilities in this area are limited. Even though I'm coming out of this class with a lot more knowledge than I did prior, I am aware that there is ***so much more to learn***, and I am excited to continue to **expand** my skills and knowledge in the field

This Digital Humanities course has *opened my eyes* to the vast array of technology and tools **available** for research data management and analysis. I am fascinated by the potential of many tools offered today that revolutionize the way we approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn more about how to apply them in my academic and professional life. I had already learned about **a handful** of resources in Digital Archive, but I learned about **another handful** in Digital Humanities. I hope to be able to take another class where I can learn **another handful** of resources while being able to use and apply the knowledge and resources I learned from the past two "Digital" classes I have taken each semester.

In conclusion, my journey through digital humanities has been ***informational and transformative***. It has expanded my horizons, bridged the gap between technology and the humanities, and equipped us with a multifaceted understanding of digital literacy. As I continue to navigate the digital landscape as a *rising sophomore in college*, I am ready to embrace new ways of thinking and working that promote interdisciplinary collaboration and responsible digital citizenship. In this age of AI, I am ready to face the challenges and opportunities that **lie ahead of me as I grow as a student and an adult.**
