# Course Reflection

As an 18 year old first year university student studying at an American Liberal Arts school in Abu Dhabi, UAE, I embarked on a new academic adventure this semester: an introductory course in Digital Humanities. It was quite a big turn from the courses I took last semester. Little did I know that it would transform the way I perceive, interact with, and create content in the digital realm. This narrative explores my evolving digital literacy journey, the strategies I employ in my daily and academic life, and my aspirations for what lies ahead. 

I applied to NYUAD planning to be a Social Research & Public Policy (SRPP) major, so I took Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences, a major requirement for SRPP and other Social Science majors, and Social Change and Development in the Arab World, an SRPP elective. I kept having crises over my major, thinking of double majoring in SRPP and Business, Organizations, and Society (BOS), then to just majoring in BOS, then to majoring in Electrical Engineering, then majoring in Film and New Media, then to Interactive Media, and now to double majoring in Interactive Media and Film and New Media. I have no experience with coding, and the most experience I have with classes about digital things was the core class I took last semester, Digital Archive. Taking Digital Archive, I learned quite a lot of things that have been brought up in this class, Intro to Digital Humanities, which makes sense because of the digital framework. Methods such as crowdsourcing, organizing data using spreadsheets, platforms such as Zotero and ArcGIS, projects such as [Cultural Heritage Preservation] (https://www.singaporememories.gov.sg/), and the [usage of AI] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X4kaiFPXz4) in the field are all things that I noticed have overlapped between the two classes. It’s very relieving to see a lot of the same material pop up in this class because at least I already know some of the things we talk about in Digital Humanities. Taking this class on digital humanities, I am learning further about how to effectively utilize technology in my daily and academic life, as well as the impacts the digital field plays on all sorts of things and all sorts of people.

In addition to the many similar aspects between this class and my previous class, another factor that has been making my experience with this class particularly enriching was the diverse group of classmates who joined me. Our majors spanned a wide spectrum of disciplines, including Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing. Together, we have explored digital literacy, each bringing a unique set of strategies and skills into the classroom. In addition, our professor mentioned that this class isn’t like your average Interactive Media class, which I find interesting and exciting since I get the opportunity to explore different areas of Interactive Digital Media from this class and the other Interactive Media classes I’m taking. Before further immersing ourselves in the world of digital humanities, we had already developed our own strategies for navigating the digital landscape in both daily life and academics.

My peers from Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing had their own digital toolkits. Interactive Media students excelled in user-centered design and interactive storytelling, often utilizing software like Adobe Creative Suite. Film and New Media enthusiasts delved into multimedia production and digital narrative creation. Environmental Studies majors leveraged data analysis software for environmental research, while Business and Marketing students honed their skills in data analytics platforms for market analysis. Students in Literature and Creative Writing dived deep into research databases to fuel their literary and artistic pursuits.
However, the digital humanities course has illuminated the intersection of our diverse disciplines in the digital age. Content creation, once thought to be confined to specific fields, took on a multidisciplinary dimension. We explored creating interactive websites, digital art installations, immersive narratives, and AI-generated content. Our collaborative efforts showcased the power of interdisciplinary collaboration, blurring the lines between art, science, and storytelling.
Social interaction and collaboration also evolved. Platforms like Slack, Discord, and online forums became hubs for exchanging ideas, sparking discussions, and collaborating on projects. We found ourselves engaging in thought-provoking conversations that spanned our areas of expertise, enriching our perspectives and generating innovative ideas. Collaborating across disciplines proved to be a catalyst for creativity and interdisciplinary thinking.


Growing up in the digital age, I have always been familiar with various social media platforms and online tools for content creation. However, I never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities.

Before enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around the basics. I knew how to use social media platforms, compose emails, and write research papers using Google Docs. I used Google Drive for document storage and Google Calendar for scheduling. My content creation process revolved around the simple tools available on my smartphone, and I hardly ventured beyond that comfort zone. Socially, I interacted with friends and classmates on Instagram, Snapchat, and iMessage, but I never delved into the deeper aspects of online communities or digital communication. I have always appreciated the convenience and accessibility of these platforms for staying connected with others. However, I have also become more aware of the potential risks and limitations of relying too heavily on social media, such as the impact on mental health and privacy concerns. I never truly explored the wealth of digital tools available for research, data management, and analysis. Frankly, I was swimming in the shallow end of the digital pool, unaware of the vast ocean of possibilities that awaited. 

Research data management and manipulation emerged as a common thread that united us all. We delved into text analysis, data visualization, and digital archives. Tools like Zotero and Omeka became invaluable for organizing, annotating, and sharing research materials. The importance of data literacy transcended individual majors, equipping us to navigate the data-driven landscape of the digital age.
Our critical reflection on our current abilities led us to appreciate the concept of “computational thinking” in the age of AI. We understood that skills in data analysis, algorithm understanding, and result interpretation were universally valuable, regardless of our major. As AI continues to shape our world, these skills will empower us to harness its potential for innovation and informed decision-making.
Digital humanities has broadened our horizons, offering fresh perspectives on our respective fields of study. We began to contemplate the ethical implications of AI and data usage within our disciplines. Computer Science majors questioned the ethical responsibilities of AI developers, while Literature and Creative Writing students considered the impact of AI-generated content on storytelling. Environmental Studies majors explored AI’s potential in climate change monitoring, and Business and Marketing students delved into AI-driven market analysis.

Looking ahead, we are excited to continue our exploration of new ways of thinking and working. We aim to cultivate a holistic approach to education that recognizes the value of interdisciplinary thinking in a digitally driven world. We envision a future where collaboration between artists, scientists, scholars, and creators becomes the norm, fostering innovation and pushing the boundaries of our fields.

Social interaction, too, took on a new dimension as I explored platforms like Quora, Discord, and Reddit, which facilitated discussions and collaboration in ways I had never experienced before. I began to see how online communities formed around shared interests, and I realized the potential for networking and learning from experts in various fields.

Furthermore, I am intrigued by the ethical implications of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices.

Despite my already limited prior experience with technology and my slight knowledge from the digital humanities course, I still feel that my abilities in this area are limited, and I would like to learn more. I am aware that there is so much more to learn, and I am excited to continue to expand my skills and knowledge in the field.

The digital humanities course has opened my eyes to the vast array of technology and tools available for research data management and analysis. I am fascinated by the potential of many tools offered today that revolutionize the way we approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn more about how to apply them in my academic and professional life.

In conclusion, our journey through digital humanities has been transformative. It has expanded our horizons, bridged the gap between technology and the humanities, and equipped us with a multifaceted understanding of digital literacy. As we continue to navigate the digital landscape, we are poised to embrace new ways of thinking and working that promote interdisciplinary collaboration and responsible digital citizenship. In the age of AI, we are ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
