# Corpus Analysis
## **Introduction**

For the second assignment in our class, we had to choose and analyze a corpus of three texts of our choice. We decided to choose three works by William Shakepeare, who is widely regarded as the greatest writer of the English language. At first we wanted to choose one play from the beginning of his career, one from the middle of his career, and one from the near end of his career. Thus, we chose *The Comedy of Errors* (1594), *Twelfth Night* (1602), and *The Two Noble Kinsmen* (1612). However, after we made the corresponding word clouds, we realized that it would’ve been quite difficult for us to examine and analyze the word clouds when we weren’t at all familiar with the plays. A quick Google summary would help us understand the general gist of the piece, but we thought that it’d be a lot easier and more efficient to focus on pieces we read before. Therefore, we concluded by choosing *Romeo and Juliet* (1597), *Hamlet* (1600), and *Macbeth* (1606), three of Shakespeare’s plays that we are familiar with, which is also because they are some of Shakespeare’s most popular plays. Furthermore, they are all similar in that they are all tragedies that end in the death of the main character. The plays have their own way of showing the internal struggles of individuals and the external situations within their societies by showing the struggles humans face with their desires, conflicts, motivations, and emotions.

After finalizing the three plays we wanted to work with, we searched for them on [Project Gutemberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) to use and input the URL onto [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) From there, we made word clouds for each of the plays. 



## **Summaries**


**Romeo and Juliet**: Tragedy published in 1597 about the romance between two Italian youths who come from feuding families. Juliet fakes her death so she can avoid marrying her father’s choice in a husband for her. Romeo doesn’t receive the clarifying letter in time and thought she actually died, so he poisoned himself to take his life, under the false impression that his lover had passed. Once Juliet wakes up from her intentional coma, she sees Romeo’s dead body and kills herself as well by stabbing herself through the heart with a dagger.

**Hamlet**: Tragedy published in 1603 about Hamlet being ordered to avenge his father’s murder. The ghost of his father, the King of Denmark, tells Hamlet that the new king, Hamlet’s uncle, had killed him. Hamlet’s journey through madness, life and death, and revenge is shown. In the end, Hamlet is in a duel with Laertes and they both get wounded by a poisoned blade. On the verge of death, Hamlet kills his uncle, then dies. 

**Macbeth**: Tragedy published in 1623 about the story of Scottish general Macbeth, who was told by three witches that he will become King of Scotland. His wife encourages him to kill the current king, and he does. Now as king, he left with constant guilt and paranoia. He’s reassured by the witches as they told him that he would remain undefeated until Birnam Wood came to Dunsinane and that no man born of woman could harm him. Unfortunately, Birnam Wood did in fact come to Dunsinane as an army of soldiers carried branches of Birnam trees to camouflage with the forest. Additionally, mid-duel, Macbeth realizes he was actually not safe from fighting Macduff since Macduff is a child of a cesarean birth. Macbeth ultimately submits to his enemy and is beheaded.

Now that we all have a brief understanding of the plays, we can move onto the analysis. Given that Shakespeare’s works are scripts for plays, it makes sense that for all works the frequency of names is the highest, followed by shortened versions of the names. 


## **Analysis:**

**Romeo and Juliet**

![Romeo and Juliet](/assets/images/Romeo.png)

Romeo and Juliet is a story that most, if not all students in the world know about. Even if you have not read it, the story of Romeo and Juliet is inescapable. One of the most interesting things we noticed from this word cloud is the fact that the word Juliet wasn’t used as much as we thought it would be, considering the story was about her and Romeo. Romeo was used a total of 143 times, whereas Juliet showed up only 65 times. One reasoning for this may just be the amount of lines each character has. Another reason could be the amount of times “Rom.” or “Jul.” is used instead of “Romeo” or “Juliet.” Putting the character names aside, we can see that words relating to love and conflicts are common terms. This includes: “love,” “death,” “wife,” “dead,” “married.” This makes sense given the plot of the play, which has to do with the romantic conflict between Romeo and Juliet that ultimately leads to their death. From this we learned that repetition of certain words in a word cloud can help us piece together what the central theme of the text may be.\

The following is an interactive visual taken from voyage called, *bubble*. This visual shows the most frequent words and their usage as we go through the document. An interesting usage for this visual when analyzing a play is noticing the frequency of names when it goes through the script. For example, if we focus on 'Romeo' or 'Rom', we can see when this character appears the most within the play, which when you look at the graphic, shows an increasing amount of 'Rom', near the middle of play.

**Hamlet**

![Hamlet](/assets/images/hamlet.png)

Moving onto Hamlet, if we again ignore the names of characters, we see a lot of words that we don’t see today in modern day English, such as “deere,” “giue,” “neuer,” “doth,” “hast,” “o’re.” We actually still have these words in modern day English, but they’re spelt differently. “Deere” is “dear,” “giue” is “give,” “doth” is “do,” “hast” is “have.” In addition, there are a lot of words that are the same in modern day English, but have an extra -e at the end of the word, such as: “madnesse,” “speake,” “againe,” “poore,” “feare,” “faire.” This could be from the evolution of the English language, where silent -e’s were more common, but were later dropped to simplify writing. It is interesting how Hamlet has “deere,” “faire,” etc, but Romeo and Juliet, which was published before Hamlet, uses “dear” and “fair.” Unlike the word cloud for Romeo and Juliet, it is much harder to draw the connections between the words in this word cloud to try to form a central theme without knowing any context. Knowing context, we can see “ghost,” “death,” “dead,” “father,” “king,” “mad,” “madnesse,” “feare,” and such, which are keywords in the plot of Hamlet seeking vengeance for the death of his father, the former King of Denmark.

**Macbeth**

We found that the word cloud for Macbeth was the most interesting to look at if you had no prior knowledge of the plot of Macbeth. Common words like: “fear,” “death,” “murderer,” “poor,” “bloody,” “strange,” “dead,” are all quite noticeable as they’re all in a bright red. These common words make it seem like the play’s genre is horror and has to do with a scary, bloody, murder. Other words like “witch” and “king” make sense knowing that the three witches told Macbeth he’ll become king, which is the start to all of the chaos that leads to bloody murders and paranoia.

## **Conclusion/Reflection**

This assignment would work mostly for languages based in the alphabet based languages. For example, in Chinese, this assignment may not work as well due to the language being character-based and not having words being separated by spaces (Recaurte). This would mean that the characters with high frequency will not give you much information because the characters themselves may not mean anything. It is much difficult, and maybe even impossible to have an automation that could split the characters into meaningful phrases. 

This assignment has opened up different ways to present data or information that would otherwise be hard to visualize. As mentioned in Drucker's book, data visualized is easier to analyze a large amount of information (Drucker 86). For example, our use of the bubbles and word cloud made it easier on the eyes to look at the frequency of words as opposed to a large spreadsheet. The way we choose to visualize a dataset has just as much of an impact as the data choose. 

After completing this assignment, we found that our experience with using Voyant Tools was intriguing and informative, as we analyzed some of Shakespeare’s play scripts by looking at the frequency of certain words. We were briefly able to spot the themes of each play and we were able to observe how many lines some of the characters had. Doing word cloud analysis for character participation in a play was very interesting because a character might’ve participated more or less than you’d expect from their character role (main character, background character, etc). Without computer assistance, it would have been very time consuming and boring to count each character’s number of lines.
